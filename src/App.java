 * Given:
 * A random number between 1 and 20 is given in the variable secretNumber
 * 
 * Task begins:
 * 1. Continually take input from the user until they guess the correct number.
 * STOP HERE FOR A B
 * 
 * 2. Modify #2 so that it only accepts values between 1 and 20 (inclusive).
 *    If the number is too high or low, give a message telling the user to
 *    enter a valid number. Do not evaluate their guess. 
 * STOP HERE FOR A B+
 * 
 * 3. Modify your code so that it keeps track of the number of guesses. When
 *    the correct number is guessed, report out the number of tries.
 * STOP HERE FOR AN A-
 * 
 * 4. Give the player feedback about their guess:
 *    - If the guess is higher than the secret, say "Lower"
 *    - If the guess is lower than the secret, say "Higher"
 *    - After 4 wrong valid guesses, give ONE hint about even/odd:
 *     "Hint: the secret number is even." OR "Hint: the secret number is odd."
 * STOP HERE FOR AN A+
